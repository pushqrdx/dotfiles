# Zsh

I don't use any plugin managers for zsh, all you have to do is clone these plugins into `.config/zsh/plugins`

+ fast-syntax-highlighting.plugin.zsh
+ zsh-abbr.zsh
+ zsh-autosuggestions.zsh
+ colorize.plugin.zsh
+ command-time.plugin.zsh
+ places.plugin.zsh
+ appup.plugin.zsh
+ you-should-use.plugin.zsh
+ iterm2-shell-integration.zsh
